            Guided meditation is a form of meditation that utilizes several different techniques to achieve or enhance
            the meditative state. It may simply be meditation done under the guidance of a trained practitioner or
            teacher and may include the use of imagery or music. Guided meditation can be helpful for people who are
            trying to meditate for the first time. The benefits of meditation extend far beyond relaxation. It can help
            reduce anxiety, depression, insomnia, general pain, and high blood pressure. The videos on this page will
            provide you with resources on how to get started!
