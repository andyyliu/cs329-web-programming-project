            Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines that originated in ancient
            India. In current times, yoga often refers to an exercise that consists of postures or asanas. Yoga is an
            exercise that can help bring together the mind and body. It incorporates breathing exercises, meditation,
            and poses that will help encourage relaxation and reduce stress. Yoga can also reduce inflammation, improve
            heart health, fight depression, reduce chronic pain, increase sleep quality, improve breathing and
            flexibility, relieve migraines, and increase strength.

            This video is a guided yoga video taught Briohny Smyth, a yoga teacher. This type of yoga is called the
            Power
            Vinyasa Flow. It is a powerful, energetic form of yoga that allows you to fluidly move from one pose to the
            next while connecting your breathing to your movements. It is fast-paced and focuses on building strength
            and endurance. Although this still requires mindfulness and focus on breathing, power yoga is more dynamic
            than other meditative forms of yoga, which means it is a good cardio and strength workout. In this 30 minute
            video, Smyth will perform each pose and exercise with you, as well as narrate the actions required.
